## **üèóÔ∏è Project Overview**

**Describe:**

* The name of the Kaggle competition is WiDS: AI for Female Brain Health. Kaggle Competition Host is Women in Data Science Worldwide. Its connection to the Break Through Tech AI Program is the machine learning skills we learned throughout the program. In BTT AI, we learned essential ML concepts such as data preprocessing, training models, and working with datasets, which directly prepared us for competitions like this.

* The objective of the challenge is using fMRI data to build a model to predict both an individual‚Äôs gender and their ADHD diagnosis (target variables: 1) ADHD (1 - yes, 0 - no) and  2) female (1 - yes, 0 - no)).

Project Question: ‚ÄúWhat brain activity patterns are associated with ADHD; are they different between males and females, and, if so, how?‚Äù

* The real-world significance of the problem and the potential impact of your work is to help girls and women be diagnosed with ADHD earlier, allowing them to get more equitable accommodations.

## **üìä Data Exploration**

**Describe:**

* The dataset(s) used (i.e., the data provided in Kaggle \+ any additional sources) 
The dataset provided in Kaggle is part of the Healthy Brain Network (HBN) initiative by Child Mind Institute. The datasets consist of functional MRI connectome matrices, socio-demographic information, emotional assessments, and parenting data for over 1,200 children and adolescents. 

* Data exploration and preprocessing approaches
We used Pandas and NumPy to clean and organize data. To ensure all features were on the same scale, we applied StandardScaler. Using SMOTETomek, we worked on class imbalance, which is when a target class has more samples than another. We filled in missing values and dealt with outliers through imputation. The preprocessing helped ensure that the data we worked with for our model is clean and balanced.

* Challenges and assumptions when working with the dataset(s)
One challenge we faced was trying to improve our accuracy score.
